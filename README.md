# Food-Redistribution-System

Our **Food Redistribution System** is a database-driven platform designed to connect surplus food from donors (restaurants, grocery stores, individuals) to receivers in need (charities, shelters, food banks). The system efficiently stores and manages data on food availability, donors, receivers, and delivery logistics.  

Built as part of our **Database Systems** course, this project is developed by a team of three students. It ensures real-time tracking of food donations, minimizes waste, and optimizes food distribution through structured database queries and relationships.
